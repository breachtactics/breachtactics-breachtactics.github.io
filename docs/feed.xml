  <summary>As organizations race to adopt the latest in artificial intelligence (AI), I was looking for training that addressed its unique attack surface and tested my skills in exploiting large language models (LLM).

  <summary>One of the many rabbit holes Ive gone down recently was the use of WiFi to track client devices. While this technique is not new by any means, I recall seeing matt0177s 2022 Blackhat USA talk where he demonstrated using signal intelligence emitted from personal devices as a means of counter surveillance. This was the first practical application of device tracking I was exposed to and wanted to ...</summary>
